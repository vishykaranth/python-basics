text = "But what about deployment? How can you make sure that a code change is sent to all your servers without one server still serving old code? This tricky problem is fortunately already solved by the great tool Capistrano. It requires some learning, especially if you are not into Ruby on Rails, but it is definitely both the effort.After “outsourcing” your sessions and serving the same codebase from all your servers, you can now create an image file from one of these servers (AWS calls this AMI - Amazon Machine Image.) Use this AMI as a “super-clone” that all your new instances are based upon. Whenever you start a new instance/clone, just do an initial deployment of your latest code and you are ready!"
